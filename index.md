I am a computer scientist major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2029


## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs


Lab, 2 Part 1
My favorite part was figuring out the pattern of the madlib and how to write. It was challenging at first as it was my first lab that was the initial start of learning C++. Another thing I liked about it was the objective was to make a madlib which I like making. Lastly, I also liked this lab because it helped me better understand the fundamentals of C++.


Lab, 3 Part 1
My favorite part of this lab was using an equation and applying it in a computer language. Yet it was also challenging to apply it to what the objective code wanted me to do. Another thing I liked was the overall experience of learning how to do this type of program. As I feel I will need it in the future when I graduate from CSUF.


Lab, 10 Part 1
My favorite part of this lab was better understanding how arrays work and how they function using large arrays. Also another thing is understanding how to better apply equations in a computer language. Yet for challenging it during the lab it helped me improve to understand how C++ works. Lastly, I found this lab important in better understanding C++ basics.
